description: Load coding standards and conventions for this Next.js web project. Use when you need guidance on TypeScript patterns, Tailwind conventions, server/client component boundaries, folder layout, or env var handling.
---

Apply the following standards to all code in this project.

## TypeScript

- Never use `any` — use proper types, generics, or type guards
- Never use `as` assertions — fix types at the source (exception: `as const`)
- `tsconfig.json` runs `"strict": true` — never weaken it or add per-file `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-expect-error` to silence an error you can fix
- After any code change, run `tsc --noEmit` and fix **all** errors (zero errors is a baseline)
- Named exports only — no `export default` (exception: Next.js requires default exports for `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, and `middleware.ts` config-less files). One file = one component/hook; the file name and export name match 1:1
- No `React.FC` — type props inline or with a separate `type Props = {…}`
- Never import React as a default — `import React from 'react'` is not needed with the new JSX transform; import only what you use: `import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'`
- Arrow functions everywhere — `const MyComponent = () => …`; never `function` declarations for components, hooks, or helpers (exception: route handlers export `async function GET/POST` per Next.js convention)
- Prefer union types over multiple boolean flags: `type Status = "idle" | "loading" | "error"` instead of `isLoading + hasError`
- Type/interface names: no `T` or `I` prefix; self-documenting plain English; no abbreviations (except universally known ones like `API`, `URL`)
- Helper function naming: `get*` / `set*` / `create*` for synchronous; `fetch*` / `post*` / `patch*` / `delete*` for API calls; `is*` / `are*` for type guards and predicates

## Folder layout (App Router)

```text
app/                    # routes only — thin files that compose from src/
  (auth)/login/page.tsx
  (dashboard)/…/page.tsx
  api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
  layout.tsx
  globals.css
src/
  components/           # shared UI (atoms → composed), one folder per component
  features/<feature>/   # feature slices: components, hooks, schema, queries per feature
  hooks/                # cross-feature hooks
  lib/                  # clients & pure utils: supabase/, stripe.ts, utils.ts
  lib/database.types.ts # GENERATED — never hand-edit
middleware.ts
```

- Route files (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`) stay thin — compose from `src/features/` and `src/components/`; no business logic in `app/`
- Route groups `(auth)` / `(dashboard)` split public from protected layouts without affecting URLs
- Keep files under **500 lines** — split into sub-components, hooks, or utils proactively
- Path alias: `@/*` → `./src/*` (defined in `tsconfig.json`)

## Server vs client components

- **Server by default.** No `"use client"` unless the component uses state, effects, event handlers, or browser APIs
- Push `"use client"` to the **leaves** — an interactive button doesn't make its whole page client; extract the interactive part
- Server-only secrets (service-role key, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`) live in modules marked `import "server-only"` — the bundler then errors if a client component ever imports them
- Never pass a Supabase client, class instance, or function across the server→client boundary — props must be serializable
- Data flows down: server components fetch and pass initial data; client components hydrate it into React Query when interactivity needs it (see `data-fetching`)
- `middleware.ts` runs on the edge — keep it to session refresh + redirects; no database queries

## Tailwind CSS (v4)

Tailwind v4 is CSS-first: there is no `tailwind.config.js` by default. Tokens are CSS variables declared in `app/globals.css` via `@theme`, and every `@theme` variable generates the matching utilities:

```css
@import 'tailwindcss';

@theme {
  --color-surface: oklch(0.98 0 0);
  --color-surface-card: oklch(1 0 0);
  --color-border-subtle: oklch(0.92 0 0);
  --color-text-secondary: oklch(0.45 0 0);
  --color-brand: oklch(0.55 0.2 260);
  --radius-card: 0.75rem;
}
```

- **No inline styles** — `style={{…}}` is banned except for genuinely dynamic values (e.g. a computed chart width); leave a `// NOTE: inline style required — <reason>` when unavoidable
- **No ad-hoc colors** — never `text-[#333]` or `bg-[rgb(…)]`; if the color isn't a token, add it to `@theme` first
- **No arbitrary values when a scale token exists** — `p-[13px]` is a smell; use the spacing scale (`p-3`, `p-4`). Arbitrary values are acceptable only for one-off constraints the scale genuinely can't express
- **Class ordering is automated** — `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` sorts classes; never hand-order or fight the formatter
- **Conditional classes via `cn()`** (`src/lib/utils.ts`, clsx + tailwind-merge) — never template-string concatenation, which breaks tailwind-merge deduping:

  ```tsx
  <button className={cn('rounded-md px-4 py-2', isActive && 'bg-brand text-white', className)} />
  ```

- Dark mode via CSS variables: redefine the `@theme` variables under the dark selector rather than sprinkling `dark:` variants on every element; use `dark:` only for genuinely per-element exceptions
- Repeated class combos: extract a component, not an `@apply` rule — `@apply` hides the design system from the markup and resists tailwind-merge

## React / Components

- Follow React best practices (hooks, memoization, clean component structure)
- Never use `eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` — fix the dependency issue
- Conditional rendering: use ternary (`condition ? <X /> : null`), not `&&` — the `&&` form renders `0` when condition is a falsy number
- No margin on custom components — margins create invisible coupling between sibling layout. Use `gap-*` on the parent flex/grid container, or padding on a container instead
- Component checklist before creating: does `src/components/` already have it? Never reimplement an existing component
- Every list page renders four states deliberately: loading (`loading.tsx` or a skeleton), error (`error.tsx` boundary), empty (designed empty state, not a blank div), and data
- Images: `next/image`, never `<img>`; links: `next/link`, never `<a>` for internal navigation

## Forms & validation

- react-hook-form + zod for every form — see the `form` skill
- **zod parses every boundary**: route handler bodies, server action inputs, search params, and webhook payloads. Client-side validation is UX; server-side parsing is the security layer. The same schema file serves both
- Never use `.optional()` to silence TS errors — fix the type at the source

## State ownership

| Layer | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Server state | React Query (client) / direct fetch (server components) |
| URL state | search params (`useSearchParams` / typed helpers) — filters, tabs, pagination live in the URL so views are shareable |
| Local UI state | `useState` / `useReducer` in the component that owns it |

If data comes from the database it belongs in React Query or a server component — never copied into long-lived client state. Reach for a global store (Zustand) only when genuinely cross-cutting client state appears (rare in a dashboard); get explicit agreement first.

## Env vars / Doppler

- Secrets via Doppler — configs `dev` / `stg` / `prd`; `.env.local` is generated, gitignored, and never the source of truth
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix **only** for values that are safe in the browser bundle (Supabase URL + anon key, Stripe publishable key, Sentry DSN). Everything else stays unprefixed and server-only
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_` values are inlined at build time** — changing one requires a rebuild, not just a restart, and per-environment builds must run with that environment's Doppler config
- Never read `process.env` deep in components — access env in a small config module so missing vars fail loudly in one place

## Formatting

Prettier owns formatting — never hand-adjust quotes, semicolons, or wrapping. Run format-on-save (or `prettier --write`) and let it win. The project `.prettierrc` enforces:

- **Single quotes** — `'foo'`, never `"foo"` (`singleQuote: true`). Prettier still emits double quotes inside JSX attributes; that is expected, leave it.
- **Always semicolons** — terminate every statement (`semi: true`).
- Trailing commas everywhere (`trailingComma: "all"`), 2-space indent (`tabWidth: 2`), 100-char width (`printWidth: 100`).
- `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` sorts Tailwind classes — it must stay last in the `plugins` array.
- Formatting must be **gated**, not just configured. `format:check` (`prettier --check .`) runs in the pre-push hook next to `check:tsc` and `lint`, and again in the `quality-checks` CI workflow. A `.prettierrc` with no gate is exactly how a repo drifts from its own config.

## CI / GitHub Actions

- Run a **quality-gate workflow** (`quality-checks.yml`) on every PR and on pushes to long-lived branches: `check:tsc` + `lint` + `format:check` + `test`, on source only (no Doppler/.env). It mirrors the pre-push hook so drift cannot slip through when hooks are bypassed (`--no-verify`) or uninstalled.
- **Corepack / Yarn-4 + `setup-node` trap:** `actions/setup-node@v5` defaults `package-manager-cache: true`, which runs `yarn cache dir` using the runner's **global Yarn 1.x before `corepack enable`**. Because `package.json` pins `yarn@4.x` via `packageManager`, global Yarn 1 refuses and the step **fails**. Every `setup-node` step in a Corepack/Yarn-4 project must set `package-manager-cache: false`.
- When major-bumping a GitHub Action (or Next.js), check the changed **defaults**, not just the inputs you pass — and verify with a real CI run before trusting it.

## Supabase custom schema setup

When using a custom schema (e.g. `api` instead of `public`), two steps are required before the app can query it:

**1. Expose the schema in PostgREST** — Supabase only exposes `public` and `graphql_public` by default. Add your schema via **Supabase dashboard → Settings → API → Exposed schemas**. Without this, every query returns `PGRST106: Invalid schema`.

**2. Grant privileges to roles** — Supabase no longer auto-grants privileges to `anon`/`authenticated`/`service_role` on new tables (effective 2026-05-30 for new projects, 2026-10-30 for existing). Every migration must include explicit grants:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON api.your_table TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON api.your_table TO service_role;
-- anon typically gets no access to B2B dashboard tables (requires auth)
```

Without this, authenticated users get `42501: permission denied for table`.

The Supabase clients must also declare the schema:

```ts
createBrowserClient<Database>(url, key, { db: { schema: 'api' } })
```

## Multi-tenancy — the house rule

Every tenant-owned table carries the tenant column (`business_id`); every query, RLS policy, route handler, and server action scopes through it via the caller's **membership**, never a client-supplied id. One business seeing another's data is the worst bug this codebase can ship — treat any shortcut here as a blocker in review.

## Supabase deployment rule

**Always apply every server-side fix — migrations, RLS policies, DB schema changes, edge functions — to both stg AND prd.** Client code is deployed once, but server-side changes are per-project. Never leave one Supabase project behind — if only stg is fixed, bugs become impossible to reproduce in production while staging appears healthy.

## Dates

- Format dates with `date-fns` — pass an explicit locale for locale-aware output
- Render timestamps client-side or pass a fixed formatted string from the server — naive `toLocaleDateString()` in a server component formats in the *server's* locale/timezone and can hydration-mismatch against the client

## Unit / Component Tests

- Test runner: Vitest; render helper: `@testing-library/react`
- Always wrap renders in a `renderWithProviders` helper that includes the QueryClient provider
- Assert on what the user sees (`screen.getByText`, `screen.getByRole`) — never on internal state
- Run `/react-web-plugin:testing` for canonical test patterns and provider setup
