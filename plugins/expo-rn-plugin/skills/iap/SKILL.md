description: Mobile in-app purchases and subscriptions via RevenueCat. Use when implementing App Store / Google Play subscriptions, consumable products, or entitlements. Distinct from Stripe — RevenueCat handles store billing; Stripe handles server-side payments.
---

## RevenueCat vs Stripe

| Use case | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| App Store / Play Store subscriptions and IAP | **RevenueCat** |
| Server-initiated charges, web payments, custom billing | **Stripe** |

Never try to handle App Store or Google Play billing through Stripe — Apple and Google require their own billing SDKs.

## Project structure

A single RevenueCat project contains one app per platform × environment (typically 6 apps: iOS × {qa, stg, prd} + Android × {qa, stg, prd}). All apps in a project share entitlements, offerings, and webhook config.

Some setups instead use **separate RevenueCat projects per environment** (e.g. "<app> stg" and "<app> prd"), each with its own bundle id and its own `RC_MCP_API_KEY` (v2 secret keys are project-scoped). When stg and prd hold different keys, a single MCP server can only reach one project.

## RevenueCat MCP — reaching stg vs prd

Every MCP launches via `bin/mcp-run.sh`, which runs `doppler run -c <config>` where `<config>` comes from the app's `mcp.config.json` (`doppler.config`, usually `stg`). So the **`revenuecat`** MCP server boots with the stg/default `RC_MCP_API_KEY` and **403s on the prod project** ("API key does not belong to project").

This plugin also ships a **`revenuecat-prd`** server that forces `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_DOPPLER_CONFIG=prd` (mcp-run.sh re-applies this override after reading `mcp.config.json`, so it keeps the app's Doppler project but switches to the prd config/key). Use the `revenuecat-prd__*` tools for production paywalls/products; restart MCP servers once after a fresh checkout so it appears.

If a restart isn't possible, drive the RC MCP over HTTP directly with the prd key (stateless JSON-RPC, but Cloudflare bans the default urllib UA — send `User-Agent: node`):

```bash
KEY=$(doppler secrets get RC_MCP_API_KEY -p <project> -c prd --plain)
curl -s -A node -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST https://mcp.revenuecat.ai/mcp \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"edit-paywall-ai","arguments":{...}}}'
```

Plain reads work via REST too: `curl -A node -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" https://api.revenuecat.com/v2/projects`.

## Paywall editing (RevenueCat) — gotchas

Hard-won lessons from editing RevenueCat v2 paywalls:

- **The AI paywall editor (`edit-paywall-ai`) can't reliably target individual carousel slides/pages.** It tends to edit a hero/base image layer and silently leave per-page images untouched — and still reports success. For a surgical per-slide change (e.g. swap one slide's image), use a **direct REST `PATCH`** instead (below).
- **Edits save as an unpublished draft — you must Publish** for them to go live, and the SDK/builder **caches**, so cold-start the app (or hard-refresh the builder) to see changes. "Still wrong after editing" is almost always an unpublished draft or stale cache.
- **Verify by data, not by the render the editor returns** — fetch the published config and check the actual per-slide image URLs and `components_localizations`.
- **Custom fonts:** a text component referencing a font **not in the project's custom-font list** blocks publishing (`"…font is not present in the custom font list"`). The list is often empty, so set such text to the default font (drop `font_name`).
- **Paywall localization is separate from app i18n.** It lives in `components_localizations`, defaults to `en_US` only, and uses RevenueCat's own locale codes — valid examples: `en_US, es_ES, es_419, fr_FR, fr_CA, pt_BR, pt_PT, ar_SA, id, it, ja, de_DE` (a bad code returns 422 listing the accepted set).
- **`assets.pawwalls.com` image URLs are public** and reusable across projects/screenshots; assets are per-project, so the same picture uploaded to stg and prd gets different IDs.

### Direct REST PATCH for a paywall

`PATCH /v2/projects/{id}/paywalls/{pwid}` requires the **full** revision payload: `revision` (current value, for optimistic locking — 409 if stale), `components_config`, `components_localizations`, and `default_locale`. Workflow: GET `…?expand=components`, modify only what you need in the current published config, then PATCH, then Publish.

An image `source.light` must be a **complete** object (`webp` + `heic` + `*_low_res` + `original` + `width` + `height`) or it renders inconsistently across platforms — copy a complete source from a working slide rather than hand-building one. The bearer key is **per-project** (stg and prd each need their own — see "reaching stg vs prd" above).

## Installation

```bash
yarn expo install react-native-purchases react-native-purchases-ui
```

Doppler keys per environment:

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_API_KEY` | iOS production key (`appl_…`) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_ANDROID_API_KEY` | Android production key (`goog_…`) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_TEST_API_KEY` | Test Store key (`test_…`) — **required in stg AND prd Doppler configs** |
| `RC_MCP_API_KEY` | Secret key for RC API/MCP calls (`sk_…`) |

## RC service — canonical pattern

Create at `src/services/revenue-cat/index.ts`:

```ts
import { Platform, LogBox } from 'react-native'
import Purchases, { LOG_LEVEL } from 'react-native-purchases'

LogBox.ignoreLogs(['[RevenueCat]'])

const isSandbox = __DEV__ || process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV === 'stg'

const configureRevenueCat = () => {
  const testKey = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_TEST_API_KEY

  // Use Test Store key in dev builds — simulates full purchase sheet on
  // simulator/emulator without StoreKit config or ios/ folder (managed Expo safe)
  if (testKey && __DEV__) {
    if (isSandbox) Purchases.setLogLevel(LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG)
    Purchases.configure({ apiKey: testKey })
    return
  }

  const apiKey =
    Platform.OS === 'android' && process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_ANDROID_API_KEY
      ? process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_ANDROID_API_KEY
      : process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_API_KEY

  if (!apiKey) {
    console.warn('[RevenueCat] RC API key is not set — IAP will not work')
    return
  }

  if (isSandbox) Purchases.setLogLevel(LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG)
  Purchases.configure({ apiKey })
}

const identifyRevenueCatUser = async (userId: string) => {
  await Purchases.logIn(userId)
}

const resetRevenueCatUser = async () => {
  try {
    const info = await Purchases.getCustomerInfo()
    if (!info.originalAppUserId.startsWith('$RCAnonymousID:')) {
      await Purchases.logOut()
    }
  } catch {
    // RC not configured or already anonymous — nothing to reset
  }
}

const manageSubscriptions = async () => {
  await Purchases.showManageSubscriptions()
}

export { configureRevenueCat, identifyRevenueCatUser, resetRevenueCatUser, manageSubscriptions }
```

Call `configureRevenueCat()` in the root layout before rendering any purchase UI.

## Customer identification

Wire into the auth session hook — identify on sign-in, reset only on explicit sign-out:

```ts
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
  if (session?.user) identifyRevenueCatUser(session.user.id)
  else if (event === 'SIGNED_OUT') resetRevenueCatUser()
})
```

- **Guard `logOut` with an anonymous check** — RC throws and logs "Called logOut but the current user is anonymous" when `logOut` is called on a never-identified user (e.g. fresh install). Check `originalAppUserId.startsWith('$RCAnonymousID:')` before calling `logOut`; the pattern above handles this
- Only call `logOut` on `SIGNED_OUT` event, not on every null session
- Customers appear in the RC dashboard searchable by their Supabase user ID once `logIn` is called
- **Do not guard with `Device.isDevice`** — that is an outdated pattern; RC v5+ handles simulator gracefully

## useRevenueCat hook

```ts
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import Purchases, { type CustomerInfo } from 'react-native-purchases'
import RevenueCatUI, { PAYWALL_RESULT } from 'react-native-purchases-ui'

const PRO_ENTITLEMENT = 'pro'

export const useRevenueCat = () => {
  const [customerInfo, setCustomerInfo] = useState<CustomerInfo | null>(null)
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    Purchases.getCustomerInfo()
      .then((info) => { setCustomerInfo(info); setIsLoading(false) })
      .catch(() => setIsLoading(false))
    Purchases.addCustomerInfoUpdateListener(setCustomerInfo)
    return () => { Purchases.removeCustomerInfoUpdateListener(setCustomerInfo) }
  }, [])

  const isPro = customerInfo?.entitlements.active[PRO_ENTITLEMENT] !== undefined

  const presentPaywall = async (): Promise<boolean> => {
    const result = await RevenueCatUI.presentPaywallIfNeeded({
      requiredEntitlementIdentifier: PRO_ENTITLEMENT,
    })
    return result === PAYWALL_RESULT.PURCHASED || result === PAYWALL_RESULT.RESTORED
  }

  const restorePurchases = async () => {
    const info = await Purchases.restorePurchases()
    setCustomerInfo(info)
  }

  return { isPro, isLoading, customerInfo, presentPaywall, restorePurchases }
}
```

## Free tier gate pattern

Gate a feature behind a free usage limit with a soft warning before the hard wall:

```ts
const FREE_LIMIT = 7  // adjust per feature

const remaining = Math.max(0, FREE_LIMIT - items.length)
const atLimit = !isPro && items.length >= FREE_LIMIT
const showHint = !isPro && items.length >= FREE_LIMIT - 2 && items.length < FREE_LIMIT

async function handleAction() {
  if (atLimit) {
    const purchased = await presentPaywall()
    if (!purchased) return   // draft/input preserved — user doesn't lose work
  }
  // proceed with action
}
```

UI pattern:

- Entries 1 → (limit-3): no mention of limits
- Entries (limit-2) → (limit-1): muted hint — "N free entries left — upgrade to keep writing"
- At limit: button label gets `✦` suffix, accent-coloured prompt below button
- `presentPaywall()` fires on action attempt; on dismiss the input is preserved

## Test Store — simulator/emulator testing (managed Expo)

The RC Test Store simulates the full purchase sheet on simulator and Android emulator with **no StoreKit config file and no `ios/` folder** — the correct approach for managed Expo apps.

**Setup:**

1. RC dashboard → Project Settings → Apps → **Add app → Test Store**
2. RC dashboard → Project Settings → API Keys → copy the `test_…` key
3. Add to Doppler stg: `EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_TEST_API_KEY=test_…`
4. Add to `env.template.yaml`: `EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_TEST_API_KEY={{ .EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_TEST_API_KEY }}`
5. **Add products separately** to the Test Store app — Test Store products are not shared with iOS/Android apps and cannot be imported from App Store Connect/Play Console. Use the RC API:

```bash
# Create monthly product
curl -X POST "https://api.revenuecat.com/v2/projects/{project_id}/products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {sk_key}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"store_identifier":"com.example.pro_monthly","type":"subscription","app_id":"{test_store_app_id}","display_name":"Pro Monthly","title":"Pro Monthly","subscription":{"duration":"P1M"}}'

# Attach to entitlement
curl -X POST "https://api.revenuecat.com/v2/projects/{project_id}/entitlements/{entitlement_id}/actions/attach_products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {sk_key}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"product_ids":["{product_id}"]}'

# Attach to package in offering
curl -X POST "https://api.revenuecat.com/v2/projects/{project_id}/packages/{package_id}/actions/attach_products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {sk_key}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"products":[{"product_id":"{product_id}","eligibility_criteria":"all"}]}'
```

The `test_` key is platform-agnostic — same key works on iOS simulator and Android emulator.

**Critical: Test Store products MUST have prices set in the RC dashboard.** The v2 API can create the product record and wire entitlements/packages, but the simulated price must be set via the dashboard UI — the API doesn't expose a price endpoint for Test Store products:

- Product Catalog → Products → select the test store product → Pricing → Add currency → USD → set price → Save
- Without a price, `/rcbilling/v1/subscribers/.../products` returns `{"product_details":[]}` and the RC SDK throws "None of the products could be fetched from App Store Connect" even though the test key is used, `__DEV__=true`, and all API calls return 200. The error message is misleading — it's not an App Store Connect issue, it's missing prices.
- Devices that already cached a successful offerings response (304 Not Modified) will continue working even after prices are removed, masking the issue for existing installs but breaking all fresh installs.

**Critical: `EXPO_PUBLIC_RC_TEST_API_KEY` must be in BOTH stg and prd Doppler configs.** Dev client builds (`developmentClient: true` in eas.json) set `__DEV__=true` regardless of which Doppler config they use. Without the test key in the prd Doppler config, the `if (testKey && __DEV__)` branch is skipped and the build falls through to the `appl_` production key, which then fails because the products don't exist in App Store Connect sandbox.

**Offerings must be published** (not draft) before the SDK will serve them. Changing from draft → published in the RC dashboard is required after any configuration change.

**Granting entitlements for testing:**

- Sign in on device/simulator (RC must be initialized and `logIn` called)
- RC dashboard → Customers → search by Supabase user ID → Grant entitlement → `pro`
- Test store customers may take a few minutes to appear in the dashboard
- Remove grant to revert to free tier

## Testing on a real device with Apple Sandbox

The Apple Sandbox account (created in App Store Connect → Users and Access → Sandbox Testers) is only used for the **App Store payment sheet** — it has nothing to do with your app's own authentication (Supabase/social sign-in).

You can stay signed into the app with your real account and still use a sandbox account for purchases:

1. Sign into the app normally (real Apple ID, Google, or email)
2. **Settings → App Store → tap your Apple ID → Sign Out** (sign out of the *App Store only*, not the whole device)
3. Trigger a purchase inside the app — iOS will pop up asking for an Apple ID
4. Enter the sandbox tester credentials at that prompt

The sandbox account intercepts only the payment sheet. Your app session is unaffected.

**Sandbox behavior differences from production:**

- Subscriptions renew every few minutes (1 month = ~5 min, 1 year = ~1 hr)
- No real charges — all transactions are free
- RC dashboard shows sandbox transactions separately under the customer

## Subscription status in Settings

Always show subscription status in the Settings tab with upgrade and management options:

```tsx
const { isPro, isLoading, customerInfo, presentPaywall } = useRevenueCat()

// Derive plan label from active entitlement's product ID
const activeEntitlement = customerInfo?.entitlements.active['pro']
const productId = activeEntitlement?.productIdentifier ?? ''
const planLabel = productId.includes('annual') ? 'Pro Annual'
  : productId.includes('monthly') ? 'Pro Monthly' : 'Pro'

// Dev-only: show RC user ID for easy RC dashboard lookup (long-press to copy)
const rcUserId = customerInfo?.originalAppUserId
```

- **Free**: show "Upgrade to Pro ✦" button → `presentPaywall()`; on success call `alert({ title: 'Welcome to Pro ✦', message: '...', preset: 'heart', duration: 6 })`
- **Pro**: show plan name + "Manage subscription" button → `manageSubscriptions()`
- **Hide "Manage subscription" on `__DEV__`** — test store purchases don't appear in App Store subscription management, so the button is misleading in dev builds
- Always show a `Spinner` while `isLoading` — RC takes a moment to fetch customer info
- **Show `rcUserId` in dev builds only** (`__DEV__ && rcUserId`) — makes it easy to find the customer in the RC dashboard without knowing the Supabase UUID; use `selectable` prop so it can be long-pressed to copy

## Purchase success celebration

After a successful purchase, show a prominent `Burnt.alert` with `preset: "heart"` — this renders a large centered heart animation on iOS. Falls back to `ToastAndroid` on Android via `useToast`:

```ts
const { alert } = useToast()

const purchased = await presentPaywall()
if (purchased) {
  alert({
    title: 'Welcome to Pro ✦',
    message: 'Unlimited entries unlocked. Keep writing.',
    preset: 'heart',
    duration: 6,
  })
}
```

Add `alert` to `useToast` alongside `toast`:

```ts
function alert({ title, message, preset = 'heart', duration = 6 }: AlertOptions) {
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    ToastAndroid.showWithGravity(
      message ? `${title} — ${message}` : title,
      ToastAndroid.LONG,
      ToastAndroid.CENTER,
    )
  } else {
    Burnt.alert({ title, message, preset, duration })
  }
}
```

`preset` options: `'heart'` (celebration), `'done'` (checkmark), `'error'` (X), `'spinner'` (loading).

## Setting up products (production)

1. Create products/subscriptions in App Store Connect and Google Play Console.
2. **App Store product IDs are globally unique across your entire developer account** — not scoped per app or bundle ID. If you have multiple environments (stg, prd), each needs distinct product IDs. Convention:
   - stg: `com.myapp.pro_monthly`, `com.myapp.pro_annual`
   - prd: `com.myapp.prod.pro_monthly`, `com.myapp.prod.pro_annual`
   Attempting to reuse the same ID in a second app will be rejected by App Store Connect. Google Play does not have this constraint — IDs are scoped per app.
3. In App Store Connect, the product status must be **Ready to Submit** before it appears in RevenueCat's import flow. **Your first subscription must be submitted alongside a new app binary** — attach it to the version in the "In-App Purchases and Subscriptions" section before submitting to App Review. Once that first submission is approved, additional subscriptions can be submitted independently from the Subscriptions section without a new binary.
4. In Google Play, the BILLING permission must be in an uploaded `.aab` before products can be configured. Add to `app.config.ts` if not auto-included:

   ```ts
   android: { permissions: ['com.android.vending.BILLING'] }
   ```

5. Import products into RevenueCat via **Product catalog → Products → Import**.

## Fixing a wrong store identifier in RC

The RC v2 API has no PATCH endpoint for products — store identifiers cannot be updated in place. To correct one:

1. Delete the product: `DELETE /v2/projects/{project_id}/products/{product_id}`
2. Recreate it with the correct `store_identifier`: `POST /v2/projects/{project_id}/products`
   - Omit the `subscription` duration field for non-Test Store apps (only Test Store supports it via API)
3. Re-attach to any packages: `POST /v2/projects/{project_id}/packages/{package_id}/actions/attach_products`
4. Re-attach to the entitlement: `POST /v2/projects/{project_id}/entitlements/{entitlement_id}/actions/attach_products`

## Defining offerings and entitlements

Use an LLM to break down a PRD into products, subscriptions, offerings, and entitlements for both stores before manually creating them. Prompt pattern:

> "Here is my PRD [attach PDF]. My bundle IDs are [QA/stg/prd IDs]. I use RevenueCat. Break down products, subscriptions, offerings, and entitlements for Apple, Google, and RevenueCat — show as tables."

## Android-specific

- Google requires the Google Payments merchant setup to be completed before subscriptions or IAP can be configured in the Play Console.
- Verify via Play Console: select an app → Subscriptions or In-app products — if it prompts for merchant setup, it hasn't been completed.

## App Store review — subscription & Apple Pay requirements

Auto-renewable subscriptions get scrutinized hard. Lessons from real rejections (all resolved → approved):

- **3.1.2(c) — describe the value.** Each subscription's **Description** in App Store Connect (Monetization → Subscriptions → localization) must clearly state *what the user gets for the price*. The field is short (~50 chars); a benefit list like `Unlimited entries, encrypted sync & daily reminders` is enough. A vague or blank description is rejected.
- **3.1.2 — Terms of Use (EULA) + Privacy Policy must be in the App Store *metadata*, not just in-app.** Add a **Terms of Use link to the App Description** (Apple's standard EULA, `https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/`, is the zero-effort option) and set the **Privacy Policy URL** in App Information. In-app paywall links alone do not satisfy this.
- **2.1 — don't ship the Apple Pay entitlement unless you actually use Apple Pay.** Apple **requires StoreKit/IAP for digital subscriptions — Apple Pay is not permitted for digital goods** (it's for physical goods/services), and StoreKit already gives the "pay with Face ID, no card entry" UX, so Apple Pay adds nothing for subscriptions. If `app.config.ts` adds `com.apple.developer.in-app-payments` (commonly gated on `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPLE_MERCHANT_ID`), it links **PassKit** into the binary and Apple flags 2.1 ("PassKit present, no Apple Pay integration"). Remove that entitlement (native change → needs a rebuild). To clear it *without* a rebuild, state in the version Review Notes: "Apple Pay is not implemented; all purchases use StoreKit (RevenueCat)."
- **Metadata vs binary:** subscription descriptions, the EULA link, Privacy URL, and Review Notes are all **metadata** — editable while "Waiting for Review" and resubmittable **without a new build** (reply in Resolution Center to resume review). Only the entitlement removal requires a rebuild, so batch it with your next native build.
